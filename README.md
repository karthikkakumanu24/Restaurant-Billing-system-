# Restaurant-Billing-system-
My Python project is an efficient restaurant billing system with a user-friendly interface for inputting date, table number, and ordered items. It includes a diverse menu with corresponding prices, automates total cost calculation, and applies a 7% tax for a comprehensive final bill, streamlining the billing process effectively.
